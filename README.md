#Design Patterns in Java!

In this project you can find implementations of several Design Patterns written in Java.

##Design Patterns in this project:

###Adapter:
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

###Command:
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

###Decorator:
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

###Factory Method:
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

###Iterator:
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

###Observer:
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

###Proxy:
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

###Singleton:
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.

###Strategy:
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

###Template:
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
